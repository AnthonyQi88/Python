Additional Python resources
While this course will give you information about how Python works and how to write scripts in Python, youâ€™ll likely want to find out more about specific parts of the language. Here are some great ways to help you find additional info: 

Read the official Python documentation.
Search for answers or ask a question on Stack Overflow. 
Subscribe to the Python tutor mailing list, where you can ask questions and collaborate with other Python learners.
Subscribe to the Python-announce mailing list to read about the latest updates in the language.



## Arithmetic operators
Python can operate with numbers using the usual mathematical operators, and some special operators, too. These are all of them.

a + b = Adds a and b
a - b = Subtracts b from a
a * b = Multiplies a and b
a / b = Divides a by b
a ** b = Elevates a to the power of b. For non integer values of b, this becomes a root (i.e. a**(1/2) is the square root of a)
a // b = The integer part of the integer division of a by b
a % b = The remainder part of the integer division of a by b


## Comparison Operators
In Python, we can use comparison operators to compare values. When a comparison is made, Python returns a boolean result, or simply a True or False. 

To check if two values are the same, we can use the equality operator: == 
To check if two values are not the same, we can use the not equals operator: != 
We can also check if values are greater than or lesser than each other using > and <. If you try to compare data types that arenâ€™t compatible, like checking if a string is greater than an integer, Python will throw a TypeError. 

We can make very complex comparisons by joining statements together using logical operators with our comparison operators. These logical operators are and, or, and not. When using the and operator, both sides of the statement being evaluated must be true for the whole statement to be true. When using the or operator, if either side of the comparison is true, then the whole statement is true. Lastly, the not operator simply inverts the value of the statement immediately following it. So if a statement evaluates to True, and we put the not operator in front of it, it would become False.
