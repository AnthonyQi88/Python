## Arithmetic operators
Python can operate with numbers using the usual mathematical operators, and some special operators, too. These are all of them.

a + b = Adds a and b
a - b = Subtracts b from a
a * b = Multiplies a and b
a / b = Divides a by b
a ** b = Elevates a to the power of b. For non integer values of b, this becomes a root (i.e. a**(1/2) is the square root of a)
a // b = The integer part of the integer division of a by b
a % b = The remainder part of the integer division of a by b


## Comparison Operators
In Python, we can use comparison operators to compare values. When a comparison is made, Python returns a boolean result, or simply a True or False. 

To check if two values are the same, we can use the equality operator: == 
To check if two values are not the same, we can use the not equals operator: != 
We can also check if values are greater than or lesser than each other using > and <. If you try to compare data types that aren’t compatible, like checking if a string is greater than an integer, Python will throw a TypeError. 

We can make very complex comparisons by joining statements together using logical operators with our comparison operators. These logical operators are and, or, and not. When using the and operator, both sides of the statement being evaluated must be true for the whole statement to be true. When using the or operator, if either side of the comparison is true, then the whole statement is true. Lastly, the not operator simply inverts the value of the statement immediately following it. So if a statement evaluates to True, and we put the not operator in front of it, it would become False.


## Conditionals Cheat Sheet
In earlier videos, we took a look at some of the built-in Python operators that allow us to compare values, and some logical operators we can use to combine values. We also learned how to use operators in if-else-elif blocks. 

It’s a lot to learn but, with practice, it gets easier to remember it all. In the meantime, this handy cheat sheet gives you all the information you need at a glance. 

Comparison operators
a == b: a is equal to b
a != b: a is different than b
a < b: a is smaller than b
a <= b: a is smaller or equal to b
a > b: a is bigger than b
a >= b: a is bigger or equal to b
Logical operators
a and b: True if both a and b are True. False otherwise.
a or b: True if either a or b or both are True. False if both are False.
not a: True if a is False, False if a is True.


## Loops Cheat Sheet
Check out below for a run down of the syntax for while loops and for loops.

While Loops
A while loop executes the body of the loop while the condition remains True.

Syntax:

'''
while condition:
    body
Things to watch out for!
'''
Failure to initialize variables. Make sure all the variables used in the loop’s condition  are initialized before the loop.
Unintended infinite loops. Make sure that the body of the loop modifies the variables used in the condition, so that the loop will eventually end for all possible values of the variables.
 Typical use:

While loops are mostly used when there’s an unknown number of operations to be performed, and a condition needs to be checked at each iteration.

For Loops
A for loop iterates over a sequence of elements, executing the body of the loop for each element in the sequence.

Syntax:

12
for variable in sequence
    body
The range() function:

range() generates a sequence of integer numbers. It can take one, two, or three parameters:

range(n): 0, 1, 2, ... n-1
range(x,y): x, x+1, x+2, ... y-1
range(p,q,r): p, p+r, p+2r, p+3r, ... q-1 (if it's a valid increment)
Common pitfalls:

Forgetting that the upper limit of a range() isn’t included.
Iterating over non-sequences. Integer numbers aren’t iterable. Strings are iterable letter by letter, but that might not be what you want.
Typical use:

For loops are mostly used when there's a pre-defined sequence or range of numbers to iterate.

Break & Continue
You can interrupt both while and for loops using the break keyword. We normally do this to interrupt a cycle due to a separate condition.

You can use the continue keyword to skip the current iteration and continue with the next one. This is typically used to jump ahead when some of the elements of the sequence aren’t relevant.

If you want to learn more, check out this wiki page on for loops.


## Additional Recursion Sources
In the past videos, we visited the basic concepts of recursive functions.

A recursive function must include a recursive case and base case. The recursive case calls the function again, with a different value. The base case returns a value without calling the same function.

A recursive function will usually have this structure:

1234
def recursive_function(parameters):
    if base_case_condition(parameters):
        return base_case_value
    recursive_function(modified_parameters)

## Advanced String Methods
We've covered a bunch of String class methods already, so let's keep building on those and run down some more advanced methods.

The string method lower will return the string with all characters changed to lowercase. The inverse of this is the upper method, which will return the string all in uppercase. Just like with previous methods, we call these on a string using dot notation, like "this is a string".upper(). This would return the string "THIS IS A STRING". This can be super handy when checking user input, since someone might type in all lowercase, all uppercase, or even a mixture of cases.

You can use the strip method to remove surrounding whitespace from a string. Whitespace includes spaces, tabs, and newline characters. You can also use the methods  lstrip and rstrip to remove whitespace only from the left or the right side of the string, respectively.

The method count can be used to return the number of times a substring appears in a string. This can be handy for finding out how many characters appear in a string, or counting the number of times a certain word appears in a sentence or paragraph.

If you wanted to check if a string ends with a given substring, you can use the method endswith. This will return True if the substring is found at the end of the string, and False if not.

The isnumeric method can check if a string is composed of only numbers. If the string contains only numbers, this method will return True. We can use this to check if a string contains numbers before passing the string to the int() function to convert it to an integer, avoiding an error. Useful!

We took a look at string concatenation using the plus sign, earlier. We can also use the join method to concatenate strings. This method is called on a string that will be used to join a list of strings. The method takes a list of strings to be joined as a parameter, and returns a new string composed of each of the strings from our list joined using the initial string. For example, " ".join(["This","is","a","sentence"]) would return the string "This is a sentence".

The inverse of the join method is the split method. This allows us to split a string into a list of strings. By default, it splits by any whitespace characters. You can also split by any other characters by passing a parameter.

## String Formatting
You can use the format method on strings to concatenate and format strings in all kinds of powerful ways. To do this, create a string containing curly brackets, {}, as a placeholder, to be replaced. Then call the format method on the string using .format() and pass variables as parameters. The variables passed to the method will then be used to replace the curly bracket placeholders. This method automatically handles any conversion between data types for us. 

If the curly brackets are empty, they’ll be populated with the variables passed in the order in which they're passed. However, you can put certain expressions inside the curly brackets to do even more powerful string formatting operations. You can put the name of a variable into the curly brackets, then use the names in the parameters. This allows for more easily readable code, and for more flexibility with the order of variables.

You can also put a formatting expression inside the curly brackets, which lets you alter the way the string is formatted. For example, the formatting expression {:.2f} means that you’d format this as a float number, with two digits after the decimal dot. The colon acts as a separator from the field name, if you had specified one. You can also specify text alignment using the greater than operator: >. For example, the expression {:>3.2f} would align the text three spaces to the right, as well as specify a float number with two decimal places. String formatting can be very handy for outputting easy-to-read textual output.


## String Reference Cheat Sheet

String Reference Cheat Sheet
In Python, there are a lot of things you can do with strings. In this cheat sheet, you’ll find the most common string operations and string methods.

String operations
* len(string) Returns the length of the string
* for character in string Iterates over each character in the string
* if substring in string Checks whether the substring is part of the string
* string[i] Accesses the character at index i of the string, starting at zero
* string[i:j] Accesses the substring starting at index i, ending at index j-1. If i is omitted, it's 0 by default. If j is omitted, it's len(string) by default.

String methods
* string.lower() / string.upper() Returns a copy of the string with all lower / upper case characters
* string.lstrip() / string.rstrip() / string.strip() Returns a copy of the string without left / right / left or right whitespace
* string.count(substring) Returns the number of times substring is present in the string
* string.isnumeric() Returns True if there are only numeric characters in the string. If not, returns False.
* string.isalpha() Returns True if there are only alphabetic characters in the string. If not, returns False.
* string.split() / string.split(delimiter) Returns a list of substrings that were separated by whitespace / delimiter
* string.replace(old, new) Returns a new string where all occurrences of old have been replaced by new.
* delimiter.join(list of strings) Returns a new string with all the strings joined by the delimiter

## Formatting Strings Cheat Sheet
Python offers different ways to format strings. In the video, we explained the format() method. In this reading, we'll highlight three different ways of formatting strings. For this course you only need to know the format() method. But on the internet, you might find any of the three, so it's a good idea to know that the others exist.

Using the format() method
The format method returns a copy of the string where the {} placeholders have been replaced with the values of the variables. These variables are converted to strings if they weren't strings already. Empty placeholders are replaced by the variables passed to format in the same order.

```python
# "base string with {} placeholders".format(variables)

example = "format() method"

formatted_string = "this is an example of using the {} on a string".format(example)

print(formatted_string)

"""Outputs:
this is an example of using the format() method on a string
```
If the placeholders indicate a number, they’re replaced by the variable corresponding to that order (starting at zero).
```python
# "{0} {1}".format(first, second)

first = "apple"
second = "banana"
third = "carrot"

formatted_string = "{0} {2} {1}".format(first, second, third)

print(formatted_string)
"""Outputs:
apple carrot banana
"""
```
If the placeholders indicate a field name, they’re replaced by the variable corresponding to that field name. This means that parameters to format need to be passed indicating the field name.

```python
# "{var1} {var2}".format(var1=value1, var2=value2)
```
```python
"{:exp1} {:exp2}".format(value1, value2)
```
If the placeholders include a colon, what comes after the colon is a formatting expression. See below for the expression reference.

Official documentation for the format string syntax

```python
# {:d} integer value
'{:d}'.format(10.5) → '10'
```
Formatting expressions
Expr|Meaning|Example
---|---|---
{:d}|integer value|'{:d}'.format(10.5) → '10'
{:.2f}	|floating point with that many decimals	|'{:.2f}'.format(0.5) → '0.50'
{:.2s}	|string with that many characters	|'{:.2s}'.format('Python') → 'Py'
{:<6s}	|string aligned to the left that many spaces	|'{:<6s}'.format('Py') → 'Py    '
{:>6s}	|string aligned to the right that many spaces	|'{:>6s}'.format('Py') → '    Py'
{:^6s}	|string centered in that many spaces	|'{:^6s}'.format('Py') → '  Py  '

Check out the official documentation for all available expressions.

Old string formatting (Optional)
The format() method was introduced in Python 2.6. Before that, the % (modulo) operator could be used to get a similar result. While this method is no longer recommended for new code, you might come across it in someone else's code. This is what it looks like:

 "base string with %s placeholder" % variable

The % (modulo) operator returns a copy of the string where the placeholders indicated by %  followed by a formatting expression are replaced by the variables after the operator.

 "base string with %d and %d placeholders" % (value1, value2)

To replace more than one value, the values need to be written between parentheses. The formatting expression needs to match the value type.

 

"%(var1) %(var2)" % {var1:value1, var2:value2}

Variables can be replaced by name using a dictionary syntax (we’ll learn about dictionaries in an upcoming video).

 

"Item: %s - Amount: %d - Price: %.2f" % (item, amount, price)

The formatting expressions are mostly the same as those of the format() method. 

Check out the official documentation for old string formatting.

Formatted string literals (Optional)
This feature was added in Python 3.6 and isn’t used a lot yet. Again, it's included here in case you run into it in the future, but it's not needed for this or any upcoming courses.

A formatted string literal or f-string is a string that starts with 'f' or 'F' before the quotes. These strings might contain {} placeholders using expressions like the ones used for format method strings.

The important difference with the format method is that it takes the value of the variables from the current context, instead of taking the values from parameters.

 Examples:

>>> name = "Micah"

>>> print(f'Hello {name}')

Hello Micah

 

>>> item = "Purple Cup"

>>> amount = 5

>>> price = amount * 3.25

>>> print(f'Item: {item} - Amount: {amount} - Price: {price:.2f}')

Item: Purple Cup - Amount: 5 - Price: 16.25

 Check out the official documentation for f-strings.


## Lists Defined
Lists in Python are defined using square brackets, with the elements stored in the list separated by commas: list = ["This", "is", "a", "list"]. You can use the len() function to return the number of elements in a list: len(list) would return 4. You can also use the in keyword to check if a list contains a certain element. If the element is present, it will return a True boolean. If the element is not found in the list, it will return False. For example, "This" in list would return True in our example. Similar to strings, lists can also use indexing to access specific elements in a list based on their position. You can access the first element in a list by doing list[0], which would allow you to access the string "This".

In Python, lists and strings are quite similar. They’re both examples of sequences of data. Sequences have similar properties, like (1) being able to iterate over them using for loops; (2) support indexing; (3) using the len function to find the length of the sequence; (4) using the plus operator + in order to concatenate; and (5) using the in keyword to check if the sequence contains a value. Understanding these concepts allows you to apply them to other sequence types as well.


## Modifying Lists
While lists and strings are both sequences, a big difference between them is that lists are mutable. This means that the contents of the list can be changed, unlike strings, which are immutable. You can add, remove, or modify elements in a list.

You can add elements to the end of a list using the append method. You call this method on a list using dot notation, and pass in the element to be added as a parameter. For example, list.append("New data") would add the string "New data" to the end of the list called list.

If you want to add an element to a list in a specific position, you can use the method insert. The method takes two parameters: the first specifies the index in the list, and the second is the element to be added to the list. So list.insert(0, "New data") would add the string "New data" to the front of the list. This wouldn't overwrite the existing element at the start of the list. It would just shift all the other elements by one. If you specify an index that’s larger than the length of the list, the element will simply be added to the end of the list.

You can remove elements from the list using the remove method. This method takes an element as a parameter, and removes the first occurrence of the element. If the element isn’t found in the list, you’ll get a ValueError error explaining that the element was not found in the list.

You can also remove elements from a list using the pop method. This method differs from the remove method in that it takes an index as a parameter, and returns the element that was removed. This can be useful if you don't know what the value is, but you know where it’s located. This can also be useful when you need to access the data and also want to remove it from the list.

Finally, you can change an element in a list by using indexing to overwrite the value stored at the specified index. For example, you can enter list[0] = "Old data" to overwrite the first element in a list with the new string "Old data".
