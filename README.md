## Arithmetic operators
Python can operate with numbers using the usual mathematical operators, and some special operators, too. These are all of them.

a + b = Adds a and b
a - b = Subtracts b from a
a * b = Multiplies a and b
a / b = Divides a by b
a ** b = Elevates a to the power of b. For non integer values of b, this becomes a root (i.e. a**(1/2) is the square root of a)
a // b = The integer part of the integer division of a by b
a % b = The remainder part of the integer division of a by b
